## Exercise 1

For each of the queries, write down the following in your notes:

- The query.
- A sentence or two summarizing what you think the searcher is looking for. For example, if the query is “Beats”, that summary might be “Beats by Dr. Dre headphones” or “Over the ear headphones by Dr. Dre”.
- For each of the query’s top 10 search results, write down:
	- The Product Id and Name
	- “Relevant” if you think this result reasonably satisfies the searcher’s intent; “Not Relevant” if it does not.
	- Whether this result is in the list of SKUs that are most clicked on for that query, based on our previous query log aggregation.
- The position of the first (top-most) result you judged as relevant, if there is one.


I think it's overall hard to know the relevance for some items, ie a cleaning kit or charging kit might interest the person who inputs a device name or type, though I have assumed as a single word query it was not their primary intent.
