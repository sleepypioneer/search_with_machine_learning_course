## Why is vector space search scoring primarily modeled after taking the cosine of the angle between the query vector and the document vector? 

- **The angle between two equal vectors (same length, orientation) has a cosine of 1**

- The angle between two equal vectors varies based on its overall vector space, but the cosine normalizes them so they can be compared equally

- The angle between two equal vectors (same length, orientation) has a cosine of 0

- Cosine is faster to calculate than other approaches

## Which of the following is not a query independent signal for ranking?

- Overall popularity of the item

- Inventory/availability of the item

- PageRank of the item

- **BM25 score of the item**

## Recall in search is a measure of:

- The number of relevant results in the top 10

- The average position of the first clicked document

- **The number of relevant results retrieved out of the total number of relevant results**

- I can’t recall
